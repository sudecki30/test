To label your data,

I have created a perceptron network with keras as :
-first layer with 6 neurons and 6 input
-activation relu
-second layers of 24 neurons
-activation relu
-thirds layers with only one neuron (because only one output/classes)
-activation sigmoid (to be between 0 and 1)

For the fit I did 50 epochs with batch size of 4. I used adam optimizer. (I have tried some other configurations; it was this one to give the best accuracy)

After I have considered labels was not a false if predict value was superior at 90%, it is possible to modify this arbitrary value.
