Objectif of this test is to develop from scratch a traffic lines detection algorithm with Python 3.x

Two line fitting algorithms 'ransac' and 'hough transform' are proposed to the candidate. Please take one from these two algorithms and implement it in python, test with the image '001109.png', and plot the detected lines as "ref_res.png".


For the i/o, gui, drawing, pre-processing parts, the candidate can use opencv or other library; for the line fitting algorithm, please implement with numpy (try to use the broadcasting property of numpy instead of for loop).

The candidate has maximum 8 hours (junior) / 4 hours (mid-level) to finish the test.
Please send the duration, the code (preference jupyter-notebook), the result image and your cellphone number to tao@anotherbrain.ai
