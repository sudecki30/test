# test
Differents tests I have passed for jobs.

I am very nice, I have not removed possible error inside the differents subject. You will find my answer without modification after to be send.

## test 1

(4 hours)
You need to develop the algorithm to find line on road without use Hough or Ransac function. You need to redo the mathematic model. 
You have the choice between Hough or Ransac test. (I take Hough)

## test 2

(3 hours)
It is mathematic test. Good luck !

## test 3

(1h30min)
You have a database, you need to annalyse and complete missed elements.

## test 4

(4 hours, but I done in only one)
You have a database with data to train a custom model. You need to distinguish if it is a false or a true label. NB you can do two class, but when it is a flase it is not a true. So I have prefered only one class, with a threshold at 90%. It is import to be sure it is a true.
